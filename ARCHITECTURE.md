# Trading App - Architecture Documentation

## Design Decisions

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a layered architecture pattern based on the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern:

1. **Data Layer**: API services, WebSocket connections, data models
2. **Repository Layer**: Data access abstraction through repositories
3. **Business Logic Layer**: BLoCs for state management and business logic
4. **Presentation Layer**: UI components, screens, widgets

This layered approach facilitates maintainability, testability, and scalability, while providing a clear separation of concerns.

### State Management with BLoC

The application uses the BLoC pattern for state management:

- **BLoC (Business Logic Component)**: Handles the business logic and state transitions
- **Events**: Input events that trigger state changes
- **States**: Immutable objects representing the UI state
- **Repository**: Abstracts data access for the BLoC
- **Dependency Injection**: Provided via Flutter's BlocProvider and RepositoryProvider

The BLoC pattern was chosen for several reasons:
- Clear separation between UI and business logic
- Testability through well-defined inputs (events) and outputs (states)
- Predictable state management with unidirectional data flow
- Reactive programming model using streams
- Strong support for Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Real-time Data Handling

For handling real-time price updates:

- **WebSocket Connection**: Established using the web_socket_channel package
- **Stream Processing**: Price updates are received as a stream of data
- **Events and States**: WebSocket data is converted into BLoC events, which then update the state
- **Immutable State**: Each price update creates a new immutable state, not modifying existing objects
- **Visual Feedback**: Color coding and animations provide visual cues for price changes

### Error Handling

The application implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

- **Custom Exceptions**: ApiException, NetworkException, etc. for specific error types
- **Error States**: BLoC emits specific error states that the UI can handle
- **Graceful Degradation**: The UI displays appropriate error messages without crashing
- **Retry Mechanism**: Users can retry failed operations through events
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicator of WebSocket connection status

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

The project follows a Test-Driven Development approach:

1. **Write Tests First**: Tests are written before implementing features
2. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Implement code to make tests pass, then refactor
3. **Unit Tests**: For models, repositories, and BLoCs
4. **Widget Tests**: For UI components
5. **BLoC Tests**: Using bloc_test package to test state transitions
6. **Mocking**: External dependencies are mocked for predictable test outcomes

## Third-Party Libraries

### Core Dependencies
- **bloc (^8.1.2)** and **flutter_bloc (^8.1.3)**: For BLoC state management
- **equatable (^2.0.5)**: For value equality comparisons
- **rxdart (^0.27.7)**: For advanced stream operations
- **http (^0.13.5)**: For making HTTP requests
- **web_socket_channel (^2.4.0)**: For WebSocket connections
- **intl (^0.18.1)**: For number and date formatting

### Development Dependencies
- **flutter_lints (^2.0.1)**: For code linting and static analysis
- **bloc_test (^9.1.4)**: For testing BLoCs
- **mockito (^5.4.2)** and **mocktail (^1.0.0)**: For mocking in tests

## UI/UX Considerations

- **Material Design**: Following Material Design guidelines for consistency
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapting to different screen sizes
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded indicators for price changes
- **Error States**: Clear error messages with actionable recovery options
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time filtering of instruments for quick access
- **Loading States**: Clear indicators when data is loading

## BLoC State Flow

1. **Event Triggering**: UI components dispatch events to the BLoC
2. **State Transition**: BLoC processes events and emits new states
3. **UI Rebuilding**: UI rebuilds based on the new state
4. **Unidirectional Flow**: Data flows in one direction (UI → Event → BLoC → State → UI)

Example flow for price updates:
```
WebSocket data → PriceUpdated event → TradingInstrumentsBloc → TradingInstrumentsLoaded state → UI updates
```

## Test-Driven Development Approach

The development followed these TDD principles:

1. **Write Failing Tests**: Tests are written first to define expected behavior
2. **Implement Features**: Code is written to make tests pass
3. **Refactor**: Code is improved without changing behavior
4. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests for all components
5. **Regression Prevention**: Tests ensure existing functionality isn't broken

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Rebuilds**: BLoC's buildWhen property is used to minimize rebuilds
- **State Immutability**: All states are immutable for predictable updates
- **Connection Management**: Handling WebSocket connections efficiently
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of resources (subscriptions, controllers)
- **Error Boundaries**: Preventing cascading failures

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Management**: The API key is stored as a constant, but in a production app, it should be:
  - Stored securely (using something like flutter_secure_storage)
  - Not included in version control
  - Potentially fetched from a secure backend

## Future Enhancements

With additional time and resources, the following improvements could be made:

1. **Caching Strategy**: Implement local caching of instruments for offline use
2. **Advanced UI Features**: Charts, detailed views, more visual feedback
3. **Authentication**: User accounts and personalized watchlists
4. **More Data Sources**: Additional data providers beyond Finnhub
5. **Platform-Specific Optimizations**: Taking advantage of platform capabilities
6. **Analytics and Monitoring**: Tracking usage patterns and error rates
7. **Localization**: Supporting multiple languages
8. **Accessibility**: Improving screen reader support and accessibility features
